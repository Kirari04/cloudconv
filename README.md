# CloudConv - Web-Based Media Converter
======================================

CloudConv is a powerful, self-hostable web-based media converter built with Go and FFmpeg. It provides a clean, modern interface to upload video files and convert them to various formats in real-time, with a robust backend that includes a job queue, progress tracking, and automatic cleanup.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Recommended)

The easiest and recommended way to run CloudConv is by using Docker. This method avoids the need to install Go or FFmpeg on your host machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:**

    Create a file named `docker-compose.yaml` and paste the following content into it:

    ```yaml
    services:
      cloudconv:
        image: kirari04/cloudconv:latest
        ports:
          - 3000:3000
        volumes:
          - ./uploads:/app/uploads
          - ./converted:/app/converted
        restart: always
        environment:
          - TZ=Europe/Berlin # Optional: Set your timezone
    ```

2.  **Create Local Directories:**

    The Docker container needs directories on your host machine to store the uploaded and converted files.

    ```bash
    mkdir uploads converted
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    Start the application using Docker Compose. It will pull the latest image from Docker Hub and start the container in the background.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access CloudConv:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:3000**.

## üîß Manual Setup (For Development)

If you prefer to run the application without Docker for development purposes, you can follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.24 or newer)
-   [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (must be in your system's PATH)

You can verify they are installed by running `go version` and `ffmpeg -version`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloudconv.git
    cd cloudconv
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    This will download the Go modules required by the project.

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
